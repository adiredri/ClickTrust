### About
My final project as part of my first degree deals with the analysis, design and establishment of an information system for managing trading in digital assets. <br>
Digital asset trading deals with buying, selling and managing different assets from different categories through digital platforms on the internet. <br>
This includes event tickets, service subscriptions, digital products and more. Digital assets can be bought and sold quickly and conveniently through systems and websites, and there is no need for physical meetings. <br>
The field offers great flexibility and the possibility of adding digital assets to an investment portfolio or for personal enjoyment. <br>

### Goals

* Automation and efficiency in trading management - to develop a system that provides automation in managing the processes of trading in digital assets. 
This can include verification processes, inventory management, order management and more, which will improve operational efficiency.
* Improving the user experience - create a convenient and friendly user interface that helps users navigate the system, perform actions easily and receive information in a clear and structured way.
* Information security and privacy - develop a system that guarantees maximum information security and privacy for connected users, including authentication mechanisms and limiting access to information.
* Recruiting and managing digital assets - enable users to manage, buy and sell digital assets easily and simply, while ensuring transparency and reliability in the trading process.
